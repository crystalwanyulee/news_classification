Wrap fee programs offer accounts in which clients pay an asset-based “wrap fee” that covers investment advice and brokerage services, including trade execution.
According to the SEC’s order, MSSB marketed its wrap fee accounts as offering clients professional investment advice, trade execution, and other services within a “transparent” fee structure.
From at least October 2012 until June 2017, some of MSSB’s marketing and client communications gave the impression that wrap fee clients were not likely to incur additional trade execution costs.
As a result of MSSB’s conduct, the order finds that certain MSSB clients were unable to assess the value of the services received in exchange for the wrap fee paid to MSSB."
