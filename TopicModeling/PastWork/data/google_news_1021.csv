A key witness in a major corruption case has accused former President Enrique Peña Nieto of directing bribes to fund his presidential campaign.
Many Mexican leaders have been accused of corruption, but no president or former president has ever been criminally prosecuted.
“This is a great opportunity to fulfill the mandate to control corruption,” said Eduardo Bohorquez, the director of Transparency International Mexico, an anti-corruption nonprofit.
“But we have seen this political game many times, and what we want to see this time is justice — not that they use the case but that they really prosecute those responsible.”"

The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, is a state-level law that requires, among other things, that companies notify users of the intent to monetize their data, and give them a straightforward means of opting out of said monetization.
Businesses will be required to comply with official consumer requests to delete that data.
Consumers can opt out of their data being sold, and businesses can’t retaliate by changing the price or level of service.

“In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the President, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead,” Roberts wrote.
The majority declined to find that the unconstitutional structure means it must eliminate the agency that Congress created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Currently banned under Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act, internal crossing allows European fund managers, who are able to cross trades, to match up the buying and selling of securities between different funds and clients internally, thus saving the payment to a broker-dealer or a trading venue for trade execution.
“Over a year that would mean between US$1.4 to US$3.2 million dollars in bid ask spreads that our clients would not have to pay, depending on the assumptions you make,” said Lance Dial, counsel at Wellington Management, speaking at the FIMSAC meeting.
Specifically, the subcommittee recommends that funds adopt policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that a vendor price is a reasonable reflection of “current market price” and that cross trades are executed for the benefit of the participating funds.
The proposal will now be open to consultation from the market; committee members noted they expect little opposition to the proposal."

The amendments replace that threshold with three alternative thresholds that combine higher amounts and shorter holding periods.

U.S. banking regulators are about to ease restrictions created in the aftermath of the Great Recession, a development that sent bank stocks surging Thursday.
The Volcker Rule is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in an attempt to prevent another financial crisis caused in part by irresponsible risk-taking at banks.
The Volcker Rule was designed to prevent banks from acting like hedge funds.

The announcement of the easing of regulations know as the “Volcker Rule” gave an immediate boost to bank stocks because the rule change could free up billions of dollars in capital in the banking industry.
The Volcker Rule was part of the overhaul of banking regulation approved in the Dodd-Frank Act passed by Congress in 2010 in an effort to curtail excesses that had led to the 2008 financial crisis, the country’s worst banking crisis since the 1930s.
The Fed said the final rule, which will take effect on Oct. 1, is broadly similar to a proposal the agencies had put forward last January.
The Volcker rule, named for its chief proponent, the late Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, generally prohibited banks from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring ownership interests in hedge funds and private equity funds."

Other moves include clarification on how foreign funds are treated and simplifying operation and compliance.
The change allows banks to provide limited services to so-called covered funds, such as hedge and private equity funds.
Randal Quarles, Fed vice chairman for supervision, emphasized that the changes do not fundamentally alter the main intention of the Volcker rule — specifically the prohibition against ""prop trading,"" or the use of bank funds in risky investing strategies like arbitrage."

Otting told reporters that the five regulators charged with implementing the “Volcker Rule,” a post-crisis rule aimed at curbing risky activity by banks, have struck an agreement on the upcoming proposal, which could be unveiled in weeks.
In August, regulators voted to ease rules policing riskier trading by banks under the rule, giving firms more leeway and simplifying requirements for permitted trading activity.
At the time, regulators said they planned to propose further Volcker simplification on the “covered funds” portion of the rule sometime in the future."

The comment period on that proposal was set to expire on Wednesday, but the regulators said Thursday they would welcome comments until May 1.
But banking agencies sought to revamp the Volcker Rule last year, finalizing a rule in August that changed the “rebuttable presumption” and implemented a three-tiered approach meant to tailor compliance requirements.
Regulators argued that allowing banks to invest in a fund structure rather than taking more direct stakes in companies would help them to diversify risk, which could in turn bolster safety and soundness."
